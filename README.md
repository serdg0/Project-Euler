# Project Euler
Hello! This is a repo I created to upload my codes solving the Project Euler challenges in Javascript.

The article that got me into accepting this challenge is [this one](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/).

I've always been attracted to this kind of challenges, and I have a lot of fun solving them!

So far I solved the first 4 of them, as the following image shows:

Everytime I had some time to spare and feel like coding I will keep working in this fun repo.

Also, eventually I pretend to writ them in Ruby. Javascript and Ruby are my main coding languages.
